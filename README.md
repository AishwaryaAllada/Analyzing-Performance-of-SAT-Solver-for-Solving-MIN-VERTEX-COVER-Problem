# Analyzing-Performance-of-SAT-Solver-for-Solving-MIN-VERTEX-COVER-Problem
In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. A minimum vertex cover is a vertex cover of smallest possible size. This problem of finding the minimum vertex cover is a classical optimization problem
in computer science. It is a typical example of NP-hard optimization problem that has an approximation algorithm. In this report, we will use three different approaches to solve the minimum vertex cover problem by using C++ program which is multithreaded having 4 threads, one for I/O, and one each for the three
different algorithms. The result shows the most effective way to solve minimum vertex cover.
